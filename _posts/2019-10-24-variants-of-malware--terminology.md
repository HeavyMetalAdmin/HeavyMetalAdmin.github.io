## Common Malware Variants

### Droppers/Downloader

* Droppers
  * \*Drop\* embedded files
  * Typically, spreads through malspam in the form of Word or Excel docs
  * Embedded executable is dropped from the malspam
    * ***Usually placed in the Temp folder***
* Downloaders
  * Same as droppers except second stage is retrieved remotely from a C2 server

### Info-Stelaers & Keyloggers

* Nearly always some form of data exfil
  * Email logs, FTP, SMTP
* Encryption methods maybe used depending on attacker level
* Usually comes with some browser or application stealing
  * IMVU
    * Stores user info in registry
* ***Common Keylogger APIs:***
  * ***GetAsyncKeyState()***
  * ***SetWindowsHookEx()***
  * ***GetForegroundWindow()***
* ***Things to look out for (Stealers)***
  * ***SQLite3 usage***
    * ***Chrome passwords***
  * ***Firefox DLL Usage(nss,mozglue..)***
  * ***Calls to CryptUnprotectData()***
    * ***Chrome password unencrypt***

### (Spam)Bot

* Once infected joins the botnet
* Botnet controlled by the botmaster
* Used for DDoS attacks or distributing malware
* Notable botnets:
  * Mirai, Satori, Cutwail, ZeroAccess

### Banker

* Extremely common with info-stealers
* Used to steak banking info
* Can be advanced but usually it's old code
  * Zeus Trojan
* Banker-Specific Capabilities:
  * Web Injection
  * API Hooking

    * This allows the malware to execute it's own function when a browser calls *HTTPSendRequestd()*, allowing for interception of the data

* Main feature is the ability to interact to the command line

### Virus

* Needs a host to get into the system
* Can be internet-based
* USB-based
* Email-based
* Infected systems
* Polymorphic changes code itself, to generate different signatures

### Worm

* Does not need a host
* Self-replicates
* Internet-based
* USB-based
* Email-based
* Infected systems
* Worms consume resources (HDD / RAM / Network)

### Botnet

* Spreads across networks / internet
* Used in DDoS attacks
* Uses multiple systems, vast amounts
* Multiple attack power
* Sends and receives coms

### Rootkit

* Slips streams itself into the kernel (lower level of OS)
* MS has ELAM

### Spyware

* Monitors web browsing
* Monitors local data
* Monitors email clients
* Collects data and sends data to other people

### Adware

* Web browser is hijacked with random popups
* Comes from websites

### Ransomware

* Locks computer down, unable to perform other actions
* Has multiple variants, most common end goal is financial gain

### Trojan

* Delivery mechanism for malware
* Opens the door for other types of malware

### Logic bomb
