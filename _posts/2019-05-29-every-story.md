# Every Story Needs a Beginning

If you had told me 14 years ago, that I would be sitting here writing  this post to you, I would have scoffed at the idea, but today the idea  of this does not seem that far fetched for myself. Throw in marriage,  kids, a mortgage and you look to reprioritize things in life, and what  you can do to make them better not only for yourself but those around  you as well. I started my journey back in 2015 when I decided to head  back to school and obtain my Bachelor's degree so that I could finally  get out of my current career choice that I had since I was 18 and move  into the ever-growing world of InfoSec. After, having graduated this  past Saturday, I can tell you it was the best decision I have ever made  for myself and my family.

 I know from the time that I decided to go back to school that InfoSec  was the field I wanted to be. It was just so fascinating, intriguing,  and in a way almost like the wild west. You have Blue Teamers (Lawmen)  trying to bring justice and stability to an ever-growing landscape of  shifting threats versus the Red Teamers (Outlaws) who are always trying  to find some gain or foothold to spread the malicious and havoc that  they thrive in. So now knowing what I wanted to do, I set out on my  journey of obtaining my goals. I suspected that there would be some  long, tough, sleepless nights, and I was right, but in the end, it all  paid off.

 I want to share my knowledge, my experiences, and everything else that I come across in the world of InfoSec. This is to keep a promise that I  made to someone long ago; that I would foster the ones after me by  spreading my knowledge and experiences with them so that we can move  this space forward. I have found these words to resonate wholeheartedly  with me, as I do feel we need to foster a stronger community in the  InfoSec world.

 With that being said, I want to thank you all for stopping by and having a look and keep an eye out for future things to come.
